# Power-BI-Portfolio-Project
The project focuses on building a condensed dynamic performance report that utilizes switch measures specifically and also bringing in some conditional formatting. This report analyzes a made-up plant company and seeks to understand the companyâ€™s pain points or potential growth areas.

Here are the steps to building this report:

Obtain the data: The data is from an Excel file with three tables.
Clean the data: Clean up the column titles and make sure the values are of the correct type. Then rename the tables.
Build the model: Create the necessary DAX measures and calculated columns.
Create the visuals: Build the layout and design of the visuals, including the DAX and conditional formatting.
Review and publish: Review the report and publish it.
The final report includes the following visuals:

A table of year-to-date and prior year-to-date sales and gross profit.
A waterfall chart showing the change in profitability.
A stacked column chart showing sales by product family.
A treemap showing sales by country.
A title and filters.
